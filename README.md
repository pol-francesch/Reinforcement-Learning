# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository was created to document how I came to create a path planning algorithm for one of my courses. In order to do this, I taught myself reinforcement learning, as well as some python, and tackled both the book by Sutton and Barto and a tutorial from towardsdatascience. Both of these allowed me to then create a working algorthim for my report.
